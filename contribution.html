                Whilst at Fairchild&comma; Moore established himself as one of Fairchild&apos;s principal technologists and managers&period;<br/>
                First&comma; he developed the firms diffusion processes and built it diffusion furnaces&comma; after this he worked on
                manufacturing processes for creating the transistor&apos;s contacts&comma; and he eventually settled on aluminium&period;<br/>
                Under his watch&comma; the planar process was also created&comma; which provided a smooth silicon dioxide surface on which
                would be printed the circuits of the first integrated circuit&period;<br/>
                Under Moore&apos;s leadership&comma; Fairchild also made contributions to the development of the metal oxide semiconductor
                field-effect transistor (MOSFET&rpar;&comma; the most commonly used type of transistor used in today&apos;s chips&period;

            <p>
                In an interview for a special edition of the journal &quot;Electronics&quot;&comma; Moore was asked to make predictions about
                developments that would occur over the next decade&period; Having reviewed past data for increases in the number of transistors
                per silicon chip&comma; Moore theorised that the number of transistors per silicon chip would double each year&period; This
                became known as &quot;Moore&apos;s Law&quot;&period; In 1975&comma; he revised this prediction so that the number of transistors per silicon chip
                would double every two years&period; This was seen as pessimistic at the time&comma; as the current rate was a doubling of transistors
                per silicon chip every eighteen months&period;

                When Moore worked for Fairchild&comma; he realised that no matter how much scientific research went into the conception
                of silicon wafers&comma; there would always be an artlike skill associated with their production&period; When he left Fairchild&comma;
                both Moore and Robert Noyce decided to merge theory and practice by forcing research scientists to work directly on chips&comma;
                especially the MOSFET memory chips that became Intel&apos;s first major success&period; Intel was also the first company to make commercially
                available MOSFET chips&period;<br/>
                In 1971&comma; Intel created the world&apos;s first commercially available microprocessor&comma; which represented a notable advance
                in the technology of the integrated circuit&comma; as it miniaturised the central processing unit of a computer&comma; allowing smaller
                machines to perform calculations originally only large machines could perform&period;<br/>
