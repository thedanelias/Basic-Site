            <p> Gordon Moore was born in San Francisco&comma; California in 1929&period; He grew up nearby in Pescadero&comma; where his father worked as the local Sheriff&period;<br/>
            Later&comma; his father was promoted to the county&apos;s Chief Deputy Sheriff&period;<br/>
            After moving to Redwood City&comma; Moore was introduced to chemistry through his neighbours&apos; chemistry set&comma; and spent hours happily making explosives&period;
            He continued to study chemistry&comma; and it soon became his passion&period; Causing him to study it throughout high school and college&period;<br/>
            He first attended San Jos&eacute; State College&comma; for two years&comma; before he transferred to the Univeristy of California Berkeley&period;<br/>
            Whilst in San Jos&eacute; State College&comma; he met his wife&comma; and they married in 1950&period;</p>

            <p>His first job was at the Johns Hopkins Institute in Laurel&comma; Maryland&comma; where he examined the physical chemistry of solid rocket fuel used
            by the US Navy in anti-aircraft missiles&period;
            However&comma; Moore soon decided that working in private industry would be far more exciting&comma; with greater rewards&period;<br/>
            In 1956&comma; Moore started working for Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory&comma; which had financial backing from Arnold O&period; Beckman&period;
            At Shockley Semiconductor&comma; Moore specialised in the complex solid-state processes for diffusing tiny impurities into silicone&period;
            However&comma; after just a year&comma; alongside other scientists and engineers&comma; rebelled against the company for Shockley&apos;s heavy handed approach&period;
            When Arnold O&period; Beckman refused to replace Shockley&comma; the group found another backer&comma; Fairchild Camera and Instrument&comma; and formed Fairchild Semiconductor&period;
            This group later became known as the &apos;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traitorous_eight">Traitorous Eight</a>&apos;&period;<br/>
            In 1968&comma; Moore along with Robert Noyce&comma; who had been his colleague since Shockley&comma; created NM Electronics&comma; which later went on to
            become Intel Corporation&period; Intel initially focused on creating semi-conductor based memory for computers&comma; however when Japanese competitors
            became more competent&comma; Intel switched its emphasis to microprocessors&period;

            <h1 id="Charity">Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</h1>
            <p>The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation was established by Moore and his wife in 2000&comma; with an initial gift of roughly &dollar;5 billion&period;
            The foundation currently has over &dollar;6 billion in assets&comma; and gives away roughly &dollar;300 million in grants each year&period;<br/>
            The grants typically focus on environmental projects&comma; where they have supported major projects in the San Francisco Bay Area and in the Andes-Amazon Basin&period;<br/>
            In addition to this foundation&comma; Moore has also supported Caltech&comma; with total donations totalling over &dollar;800 million&period; In 2007, they donated
            &dollar;200 so that Caltech could build the largest telescope in the world&period;
