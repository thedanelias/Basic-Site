                Despite Fairchild Semiconductor no longer being a functional company&comma; after being taken over by ON Semiconductor in 2016&comma;<br/>
                many of the inventions and developments made whilst Moore was there are still relevant today&period;<br/>
                For example&comma; when Moore worked on the production of transistors&comma; he decided to use aluminium as the metal used 
                for the contacts&comma; which is still the metal of choice for silicon devices today&period; The planar process was also developed
                whilst Moore was at Fairchild&comma; where individual components of a transistor are built&comma; and then those transistors
                are put together&period; This is still in use today and is the primary process by which silicon integrated circuit chips are built&period;

                Being first theorised in 1965&comma; and then revised 10 years later in 1975&comma; so far&comma; Moore&apos;s law has held true 
                despite numerous technological innovations during that time&period; However&comma; we are unlikely to ever know whether it would hold
                true in a world where it was not predicted&comma; as scientists may have been developing CPUs so Moore&apos;s law was true&comma; or it could 
                be that he made an amazingly correct prediction which has held true for the past 46 years&period;<br/>
                See the graph below for a demonstration of the theory&period;

            <p>
                Intel first started with a goal to enter the semiconductor memory market&comma; which was predicted to replace magnetic-core
                memory&period; In 1971&comma; they released their first microprocessor&period; In the early 1980s&comma; Intel&apos;s business was dominated by dynamic 
                random access chips&comma; however&comma; due to growing competition from Japanese companies&comma; Intel pivoted to primarily making 
                microprocessors&comma; which it still does today&period; Present day&comma; Intel has lost much of its market share in the high-end CPU
                market&comma; due to AMD&apos;s resurgence&period; Apple has also moved away from Intel&apos;s processors&period; Despite these recent drawbacks&comma;
                Intel&apos;s contribution to personal computers cannot be overstated&period; They created the first commercially available
                microprocessor&comma; as well as having their microprocessors being used by IBM for their personal computers&period; Intel has been at 
                the forefront of the technological hardware market for many years and it is hard to see that come to an end&period;
